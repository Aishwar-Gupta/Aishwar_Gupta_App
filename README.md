## Notes

It took me some time to install and set up Android Studio and get the App running as I am using the connected Android device.
Setting up the Emulator made my laptop slow and start to lag which was inefficient.
I also had to make changes to display the image, such as using app:srcCompat="@drawable/pexels_sagui_andrea_618833" instead in the predefined ImageView
